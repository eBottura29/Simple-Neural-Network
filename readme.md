How to use:

Run main.py for the network and comment out what you dont want (line 160-162).

Run visualizer.py if you want to see a graph of what the cost looks like over batches, nerds only.


Other shi:

Network dimensions are 4 (input), 3x64 (hidden), 2 (output).

Do whatever you want with this code i dont really give a crap.
