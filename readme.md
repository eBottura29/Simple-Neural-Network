How to use:

Run main.py for the network and comment out what you dont want (line 160-162).

Run visualizer.py if you want to see a graph of what the cost looks like over batches, nerds only.


Other shi:

This AI predicts if a point is above or below a line. Using co(x,y) and y=mx+b of course. You can use desmos to see if it's correct, but with the current dimensions, the network is 93% accurate.

Network dimensions are 4 neurons (input layer), 64 neurons (3 hidden layers), 2 neurons (output layer).

Do whatever you want with this code i dont really give a crap.
